A very simplistic example of an edge is a price "trend". Every market I've analyzed has some trending tendency, some of course more than others, but incorporating that tendency by placing orders in the direction of the trend would be a proper exploitation.

Sometimes this could be the case, but in my opinion it is important that you understand if the strategy is exploiting non-random occurrences in a persistent manner; if the strategy is not doing this, the short-term "fitted" model will fail when the market reverts to its true, more random, behavior.

From my institutional experience, I¡¯ve seen a lot of traders come and go, and a lot of them blamed their inadequacy on psychology, but I can honestly say that most of them had no real edge. I¡¯m not saying that a good psychological handle can¡¯t improve a skilled trader, but rather that most people aren¡¯t at the level where it¡¯s going to make much of a difference.
